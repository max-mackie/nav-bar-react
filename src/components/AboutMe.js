        I am extremely passionate about technology, and have found that
        programming is the perfect blend of both my logical and creative sides.
        Building upon the programming languages Python and MATLAB I learnt at
        university, I am now training to become a full stack software engineer
        with Futureproof. I am looking for an opportunity to start a software
        engineering role which requires a high technical aptitude and strong
        problem-solving skill set, where I can continue to learn and develop my
        skills.
